Installation
############


You can install the Plone add-on collective.conferences using zc.buildout
and the plone.recipe.zope2instance. Thus you could add it to the list of
eggs to install, e.g.:

.. code-block:: Python

    [buildout]
        ...
        eggs =
            ...
            collective.conferences

Once you have added the add-on re-run buildout, e.g. with:

.. code-block:: Bash

    $ ./bin/buildout


Once your buildout finished you had to create a new Plone site and then
install and activate the Plone add-on inside this new Plone site.
Therefor you had to go to the Plone 'Site Setup' adminstration area. If
you got administration permissions you find a link to it in the menu
entry with your name (or 'admin'). You could reach it directly by
adding '/@@overview-controlpanel' to the URL of your Plone site.

In the 'Site Setup' page click on 'Add-ons' and you get a list of the
Plone add-ons which are available in your Plone site.

You will get a list like in the above screenshot. Click on the
'install' button next to the 'collective.conferences' list entry
and the add-on will be installed in your Plone site.
