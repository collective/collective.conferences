Workflow
========

The content objects are assigned to the default 'Simple Publication Workflow' with the exeption of
conference talks and workshops. They have their own workflows.

Simple Publication Workflow
***************************

The default state of this content objects is 'private'. The owner (creator) of this object could
submit it for publication. This changes the state to pending and will forwarded to the review queue.

If the user want to reedit the content object, she/he could 'retract' it. The state changes back to
'private'.

If a reviewer think the content object is not ready for publication and the user (creator) should
rework (edit or make additions), she/he could 'send back' the content object to the user.

If the content object is ready for publication the reviewer could 'publish' it.

There is also an 'advanced' option for the reviewer. She/he could use it to add some notes to her/his
action (e.g. send the content object back with some notes to the creator) or set a publication date or/
and the expiration date.

to the review queue.
