Add A New Talk
==============

Once the call for papers was published and the folder for talks and workshop was created
registered users of the site could add proposals for talks. There are different ways to
do this once they are logged-in to the site.

The easiest way is by using the link on the call for papers page (see the screenshot
below).

Once the user clicks on this link the edit form for a new talk pops up.

The logged-in user could use instead of using this link go to the folder for talks
and workshops (click on the appropriate link in the navigation menu bar) and click
inside the menu bar on the left side 'Add new'. Then choose from the opening submenu
the entry 'Conference Talk' (see screenshot below).

This leads also to the edit form for a new talk proposal. This form consists currently of
four register. The first register ('Default') contains fields for the necessary data of a
new talk proposal (screenshot below).

A talk (proposal) needs a unique title, a talk summary and more detailed description. It should
have at least one presenter (speaker). But this is not mandatory to make it possible to create and
submit a new talk (draft) and ask a competent speaker later to give this talk (maybe with some
alignments).

The talk needs an alignment with one of the call for paper topics thus the review committee could assign
it to the appropriate conference track. It's also necessary to get information about the planed length
of the talk. The submitter of a new talk (proposal) will know best which time slot fits to the content of
the talk (the review committee / program owner could adapt this suggestion to the available time slots
of the program later). The entry in the field is only a proposal.

It's also necessary that the submitter of a talk proposal adapt one of the available licenses to the talk. And
it is possible to give some information to the review committee / the program owner, e.g. about the
availability or necessary environment to give the talk.

Once the mandatory fields of the 'Default' register has been filled out the user could save his edits and
the new talk (proposal) will be submitted to the review queue.

The further register of the dialog consists of the necessary fields to upload or link the slides of a
talk, some additional files / material and link to the video of the talk (if the talk was recorded) (see
the screenshots below).
