The fields on the first register 'Default' collect the values for the length of conference breaks,
talks, trainings and workshops. This fields comes already with some default value. You could replace
this values with your own choice. Every single value needs a new line.

The entries of the fields for talk, training and workshop length will be used to configure the available options
for the talk, training and workshop proposal submitters to suggest a time slot. The values of the fields are also
used by the conference organization committee to set the length of talks, trainings, workshops and conference breaks
in the conference program and its tracks.

There are also fields to set the level and the audience of trainings at the conference. This fields hold already
some default values. You could replace them with your own choice / definitions, one value per line.

The second register 'Legal' currently holds only one field to list the licenses, talks, trainings and workshops
could be submitted under. This field came with some default values too. The default values could be replaced
by new entries. Every value needs a new line.
