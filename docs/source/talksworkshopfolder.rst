Folder For Talks And Workshops
==============================

Once a call for papers has been published contributors should be able to submit
talk or workshop proposals for the conference. Thus there is the need to create
a folder for this content types on the Plone site, because this content types
are not allowed on the Plone site and its root, but only inside such a folder.

Therefore you need to create a folder for talks and workshops in parallel with
the call for papers page. But it's not difficult to create such a folder. Go
to the Plone site root ('Home') and choose from the menu on the left side the
'Add new' entry and inside the opening submenu click on 'Conference Talk/Workshop
Folder'. You will get the form shown in the screenshot below.

The title of this folder and its URL are set by default. You need only to add
a short description (summary) to the form. Once you finished this text, save
your edits. The new folder get the default state 'private' then. You need to
publish it. You could do this within the menu on the left side. Click on the
entry 'Private' and choose from the opening submenu 'Publish'.

Next you need to change the setting of the folder, thus contributors could add
their content (proposed talks/workshops) to the new folder. Therefore click on
the entry 'Sharing' of the menu on the left side. You get the dialog shown
below.

Activate the box in front of 'Can Add' for logged in users and save your
changes. The contributors are able to submit their proposed talk or workshop
yet, once they are logged in.
